System of sentences Video Question.

Given this system:


Between the dog, the cat, and the bird, one is red.
Between the dog and the cat, one is orange.
The dog is black.

Answer: Red

Is this system singular or non-singular?

Answer: Non-singular
Why? The system carries as many pieces of information as sentences
meaning that it is a complete system, which is called non-singular.

System of equations Video Question 1.
You go two days in a row and collect this information:
Day 1: You bought an apple and a banana and they cost $10.
Day 2: You bought an apple and two bananas and they cost $12.

Answer: Apple = $8, Banana = $2

See Screenshot 4.

System of equations Video Question 2.
You go two days in a row and collect this information:
Day 1: You bought an apple and a banana and they cost $10.
Day 2: You bought two apples and two bananas and they cost $20.

Answer: There is not enough information


System of equations Video Question 3.
You go two days in a row and collect this information:
Day 1: You bought an apple and a banana and they cost $10.
Day 2: You bought two apples and two bananas and they cost $24.

Question: How much does each fruit cost?
Answer: There must have been a mistake

Practise Quiz: 
Question 1.
You are an astronaut on a mission to planet Mars. Using two robotic spacecraft, the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers, your mission is to collect rock samples to bring back to Earth to determine if there is life on the red planet. As a trained astronaut, you know that each rover has a weight limit for samples.

You split the rocks between the two rovers. You first place 2 basalt samples (volcanic rock) and 3 meteorite rocks to Perseverance that weigh 15 grams in total.

You then put 2 basalt samples and 4 meteorites to Curiosity that weigh 16 grams in total. Your goal is to determine how much each sample weighs (b for basalt, m for meteorite). You know that the collected samples are all the same size and shape, so all basalt samples will have the same weight, just as all meteorite samples will have identical weight. 

To help you calculate the weight of each rock sample, your spacecraft user interface requires you to input the system of equations that represents the weights of the samples on each one of the rovers.
Which of the following systems of equations do you input?

Answer:
2b+3m = 15
2b+4m = 16

Answer: Linearly independent

Question 5.
How much does each rock sample weigh?

Answer: basalt = 6g, meteorite = 1g

The Rank of a Matrix Graded Quiz.

Question 1. 
You are a lead engineer at Stark Industries working on robotics special projects. You stumble upon the old schematics of the Iron Man suit and decide to take on an ambitious project. As a savvy engineer, you realize the potential of upgrading the exoskeleton to help people walk after a neurological injury.

To ensure your exoskeleton is affordable and slim, you generate a new composite structure combining fiberglass, aluminum, and carbon nanotube materials. Ultimately, you need to assess the price of each material. 

1st iteration:You use 7 units of fiberglass, 5 units of aluminum, and 3 units of carbon nanotubes, which cost $120.

2nd iteration:You engineer a less wasteful process that uses 3 units of fiberglass, 2 units of aluminum, and 5 units of carbon nanotubes to produce the same amount of composite, the total cost is $70.

3rd iteration: You combine electrostimulation delivery, which cuts down the cost of the suit by using only 1 unit of fiberglass, 2 units of aluminum, and 1 unit of carbon nanotubes, which cost $20. 

Which of the following represents the correct system of equations?
