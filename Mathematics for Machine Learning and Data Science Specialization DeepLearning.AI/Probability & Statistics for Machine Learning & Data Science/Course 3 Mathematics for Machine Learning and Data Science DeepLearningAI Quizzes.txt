Week 1 - Practice Quiz
Question 1. 
Suppose you flip a coin twice and observe the result. Which set below describes the sample space of this experiment? I.e., which set describes every possible outcome? Define: 
H as heads and 
T as tails.

Answer: 
{(H,T),(H,H),(T,H),(T,T)}

What is the probability of obtaining one head and one tail in this experiment (the order doesn't matter)?

Answer: 1/2

You throw a dice 
10 times and sum the results. What is the probability of getting a number higher than 
10?

Hint: Use the complement rule!

Answer: (6^10 - 1)/10

Question 4.

Answer: 1/12

Question 5.
Consider the following problem:

In an experiment there are 100 ill persons. 50 of them have headache and 50 of them have fever. 

The researchers want to find the probability of a random selected person in this experiment having headache or fever. One researcher provides the following argument:

"Since 50 out of 100 have headache, the probability of having headache is 1/2. The same reasoning can be applied to having fever. Therefore, the probability that a random selected person has either fever or headache is 1."

About their argument, choose the correct option.

Answer: 
It is incorrect, because it assumes that the events of having headache and fever are disjoint. This cannot be inferred by the experiment as it is stated.

Answer: 
Set the significance level, calculate the test statistic, calculate the p-value, compare it with the significance level, and make a decision.

Question 5.
Suppose you are conducting a hypothesis test to determine whether a new teaching method improves student performance. 

The null hypothesis (H_0) states that the teaching method has no effect, while the alternative hypothesis (H_1) suggests that the teaching method leads to higher student performance. You collect data from a sample of 50 students and calculate a test statistic of 1.98. The critical value at a significance level of 0.05 is 1.96. Should you reject the null hypothesis?

Answer: 
Yes


Question 6.
A company claims that their new energy drink decreases reaction times. To investigate this claim, a researcher conducts a hypothesis test using a sample of 40 participants. The average reaction time in the sample is 0.95 seconds, with a standard deviation of 0.12 seconds. The company states that the average reaction time without their energy drink is 1.05 seconds. The researcher wants to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the company's claim. Assuming a significance level of 0.05, what is the test statistic for this hypothesis test?

Answer: -5.27


Correct! Using the formula 
(xbar −μ)/(S/n^(1/2))
you get the result!
