See Screenshots for Week 3 49. Practise Quiz for Optimization in Neural Networks Q4.

How many parameters must be tuned to minimize the Loss Function?

Answer: 9

Why? 
Correct! We have 2 inputs, which will generate 2 constant terms (b1 and b2), since the next layer has 2 neurons, each input must have 2 parameters,
therefore the first layer has 2 + 2*2 = 6 parameters. The hidden layer, 
therefore, has three more parameters since there are 2 neurons. We also must add another constant term 
c. In total there are 9 parameters.


Question 5

Answer(s)
-It is a method to update the parameters of a neural network.
-It is a method that starts in the output layer and finishes in the input layer.

Newton's Method Video Question 
The value for 
x (k+1) is given by 

Answer: x(k+1) = xk - (f(xk)/f'(xk))

The second derivative Video Question. 
Before we formalize the ideas in this lesson, try to answer the following question:
If the second derivative of a function f(x), i.e., f''(x) or d^2/dx^2 f(x) is equal to
0 for every value of x, what can we say about f(x)? 

Answer: f(x) is a line.

Why? 
 If f′′(x)=0, then 
f ′(x) is constant! From Week 1 we know that if the derivative of a function is constant, then it must be a line (either horizontal or not)!

See Screenshots for Week 3 73. The Hessian Part 6

Graded Quiz: Optimization in Neural Networks and Newton's Method
Question 1. 
Using Newton’s method, find an approximation recursive formula for sqrt(2). 

NOTE: sqrt means square root. 
To help you, remember that sqrt(2) is the positive solution for 
x^2 - 2, so you can use for f(x) = x^2 - 2.

Answer: 
x(k+1) = xk - (xk^2-2)/2xk

Question 2. 
Regarding the previous question, suppose you don't know any approximation for sqrt(2) and only that it is a positive
real number such that x^2 = 2. Which value from the list below will result in the fastest convergence?

Answer: 2

Question 3. Let's continue investigating the method we are developing to compute the sqrt(2). Remember that we
used the fact that sqrt(2) is one of the roots of x^2 -2. What would happen if we have chosen a negative
value as initial point?

Answer: The algorithm would converge to the negative root of x^2-2.

Question 4. 
Did you know that it is possible to calculate the reciprocal of any number without performing division?
(The reciprocal of a non-zero real number a is 1/a). 

Setting a non-zero real number a, use the function f(x) = a - 1/x = a - x^-1 to find such formula. 
This method was in fact used in older IBM computers to implement division in hardware!

So, the iteration formula to find the reciprocal of 
a, in this case, is:

Answer: x(k+1) = 2xk-a(xk)^2

Question 5. Suppose we want to find the minimum value (suppose we already know that the minimum exists and is unique) of xlog(x) where
x ∈ (0,+∞). Using Newton's method, what recursion formula we must use?

Hint: f(x) = xlog(x), f'(x) = log(x) + 1 and f''(x) = 1/x

Answer: x(k+1) = xk - xk*(log(xk)+1)

Question 6. 
Regarding the Second Derivative Test to decide whether a point with 
f’(x) = 0 is a local minimum or local maximum, check all that apply.

Answer(s):
-If f''(x) > 0 then x is a local minimum.
-If f''(x) = 0 then the test is inconclusive.

Question 7. Let f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3, then the Hessian matrix, H(x,y) is:

(L), the value for ∂L/∂w1 is:

Answer: -(y-y^)x1

Question 10. Suppose you have a function f(x,y) with ∇f(x0,y0) = (0,0) and such that
H(x0,y0) =
[2 0
