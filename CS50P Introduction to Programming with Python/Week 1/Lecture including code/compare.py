#Conditions Week 1 CS50p
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

#Situation 1 (Understanding if,elif and else statements)
#if x <y:
#    print("x is less than y")

#elif x > y:
#if x > y: Still works (But pay attention to the flowchart in the lectures to see the big picture)
#    print("x is greater than y.")

#else:
#elif x >y and if x >y still works (Again, pay attention to the flowchart)
#    print("x is equal than y.")

#Situation 2 (Understanding (or), )
#if x > y or x < y:
#    print("x is not equal to y.")
#else:
#    print("x is equal to y.")


#Situtation 3
#!= notation is not equal
if x != y:
    print("x is not equal to y.")
else:
    print("x is equal to y.")
