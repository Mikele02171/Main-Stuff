with a relative cost of 4:1 and an overall accuracy of 85%.

Answer: False

Evaluation 
Video Question:
Model evaluation can have two main phases: a diagnostic measures phase and statistical significance testing. 

Answer: True


From Modeling to Evaluation Graded Quiz: 
Question 1. 
The Modeling stage is followed by the Analytic Approach stage.

Answer: False

Question 2.
Model Evaluation includes ensuring that the data are properly handled and interpreted.

Answer: True 

Question 3.
Select the correct statements about the ROC curve.

Answer(s): 
-The ROC curve is a useful diagnostic tool for determining the optimal classification model. 
-ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which was originally developed to detect enemy aircrafts on radar.
-By plotting the true-positive rate against the false-positive rate for different values of the relative misclassification cost,
the ROC curve can be used to select the optimal model.

Week 3:
Deployment
Video Question: 
Before the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work, it is deployed and put to the ultimate test.
Answer: False

Feedback
Video Question:
The data science methodology is highly iterative,
ensuring the refinement at each stage in the game.

Answer: True 

Graded Quiz From Deployment to Feedback:
NOTE: Questions may vary 
Question 1.
Feedback is not required once the model is deployed because the Model Evaluation stage would have assessed the model and made sure that it performed well.

Answer: False

Question 2. * (NOT FINAL)

What stage of the data science methodology does this represent?

Answer: Modeling

Question 3.
A car company asked a data scientist to determine what type of customers are more likely to purchase their vehicles. However, the data comes from several sources and is in a relatively “raw format”. What kind of processing can the data scientist
perform on the data to prepare it for the Modeling stage?

A. Feature Engineering.
