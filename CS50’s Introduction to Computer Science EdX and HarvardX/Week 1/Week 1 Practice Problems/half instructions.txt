Getting Started

Log into cs50.dev using your GitHub account.
Click inside the terminal window and execute cd.
At the $ prompt, type mkdir half
Now execute cd half
Then copy and paste wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/1/half.c into your terminal to download this lab’s distribution code.
You are to complete the function, half, which calculates exactly half of the bill after tax and tip are added, and returns that value.
Implementation Details
Your function should use the input parameters, bill, tax, and tip, to calculate the final amount. However, since these values are percentages, you’ll have to do some work to convert these to more appropriate formats to use for your calculation.

The tax should be added to the bill amount before calculating the tip. Finally, you will return exactly half of the full amount, including the bill amount, the tax and the tip.

Thought Question

Why do you think there are different data types in C?
How to Test Your Code
Your program should behave per the examples below.

half/ $ ./half
Bill before tax and tip: 12.50
Sale Tax Percent: 8.875
Tip percent: 20
You will owe $8.17 each!

half/ $ ./half
Bill before tax and tip: 23.50
Sale Tax Percent: 7  
Tip percent: 15
You will owe $14.46 each!

half/ $ ./half
Bill before tax and tip: 100
Sale Tax Percent: 6.25
Tip percent: 18
You will owe $62.69 each!

You can check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit, by typing in the following at the $ prompt. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

check50 cs50/labs/2023/x/half

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that check50 outputs to see the input check50 handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

To evaluate that the style of your code (indentations and spacing) is correct, type in the following at the $ prompt.

style50 half.c

How to Submit
No need to submit! This is an optional practice problem.
