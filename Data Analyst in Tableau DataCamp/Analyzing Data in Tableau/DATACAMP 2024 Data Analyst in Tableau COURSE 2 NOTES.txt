COURSE 2: ANALYZING DATA IN TABLEAU

1. PREPARING FOR ANALYSIS
Non-aggregating numerical dimensions
When a numeric value is brought into a Tableau workbook, it's placed by default with the Measures in the Data pane. All Measures are aggregated (e.g., sum, average, count) when they are brought onto the canvas. Rather than taking extra steps to overcome this default behavior, we want to move numbers that are used as labels or descriptions to the Dimensions section of the Data pane.

Which of the following is an example of a numeric field that should be moved to the Dimensions section of the Data pane?

Answer: Serial Numbers

1_1_measures

Answer: 3

Discrete or continuous time analysis?
When applying dates into a visualization, Tableau offers the ability to show them as Discrete or Continuous.

Discrete
-All months of serveral years combined into single iterations of the months for trend analysis
-A daily pattern of customer activity reflected with one axis showing the hours of the day


Continuous 
-Data shown as an unbroken time series
-Year to date sales reflected in a timeline showing marked on the axis by week

2. EXPLORING VISUALIZATIONS 
Missing information
When exploring data and preparing it for analysis, the diversity of real-world items, such as customers, may result in missing content for certain data fields.

If the cause of the missing information is understood and that item is a significant part of the overall population, what is a reasonable strategy for conveying the meaning in a visualization?

True
-Edit the null label to provide the known information

False
-Exclude the missing values from the visualization regardless of what is known
-Leave null in place as a mystery for readers of the analysis

Choosing the right chart type
Choosing a chart type is an important part of communicating insights. The number and type of elements being shown on a visualization determine the best selection. For example, scatterplots need a numeric value on each axis to be created.

Let's consider a single field in a dataset with many different, continuous, values. What is the preferred chart type to reveal the distribution of that field?

Answer: Histogram
