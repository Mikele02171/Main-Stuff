PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide equivalent).\n\nThis data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, `prouduct_emissions`, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred. Here's a snapshot of what `product_emissions` contains in each column:\n\n### `product_emissions`\n\n| field                              | data type |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| `id`                                 | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `year`                               | `INT`       |\n| `product_name`                       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `company`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `country`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `industry_group`                     | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `weight_kg`                          | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `carbon_footprint_pcf`               | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `upstream_percent_total_pcf`         | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `operations_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `downstream_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n\nYou'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"-- Complete the query\nSELECT industry_group, COUNT(DISTINCT company) as num_companies, ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf) ,1) as total_industry_footprint FROM product_emissions WHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions) GROUP BY industry_group ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC LIMIT 6;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"carbon_emissions_by_industry","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":686,"lastExecutedAt":1711434839205,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- Complete the query\nSELECT industry_group, COUNT(DISTINCT company) as num_companies, ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf) ,1) as total_industry_footprint FROM product_emissions WHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions) GROUP BY industry_group ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC LIMIT 6;","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":223,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"f76f5039-ed23-424e-84e7-143d44331a05","cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"industry_group","type":"string"},{"name":"num_companies","type":"integer"},{"name":"total_industry_footprint","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5],"industry_group":["Materials","Capital Goods","Technology Hardware & Equipment","Food, Beverage & Tobacco","Commercial & Professional Services","Software & Services"],"num_companies":[3,2,4,1,1,1],"total_industry_footprint":[107129,94942.7,21865.1,3161.5,740.6,690]}},"total_rows":6,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                       industry_group  num_companies  total_industry_footprint\n0                           Materials              3                  107129.0\n1                       Capital Goods              2                   94942.7\n2     Technology Hardware & Equipment              4                   21865.1\n3            Food, Beverage & Tobacco              1                    3161.5\n4  Commercial & Professional Services              1                     740.6\n5                 Software & Services              1                     690.0","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>industry_group</th>\n      <th>num_companies</th>\n      <th>total_industry_footprint</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Materials</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>107129.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Capital Goods</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>94942.7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Technology Hardware &amp;
