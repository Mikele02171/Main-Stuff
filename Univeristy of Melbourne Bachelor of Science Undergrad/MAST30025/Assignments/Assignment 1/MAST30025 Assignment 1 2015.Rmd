```{r}
X = matrix(c(rep(1,14),13.1,15.3,25.8,1.8,4.9,55.4,39.3,26.7,47.5,6.6,94.7,61.1,135.6,47.6),14,2)
y = c(27.3,42.4,38.7,4.5,23,166.3,109.7,80.1,150.7,20.3,189.7,131.3,404.2,149)
#Easy guess for betas and epilsons done in LaTex

```

#Part b) Normal equations 

```{r}
t(X)%*%X

```


```{r}

b
```
