1. What do you think the real problem was in this case? 

2. Was Nick a good project manager? Why or why not? 

3. What should top management have done to help Nick? 

4. What could have Nick done to be a better project Manager?

Answer text Question 1

Real Problem: The real problem in this case seems to be a misalignment of expectations and roles. Top management expected Nick to perform the duties of a project manager, such as providing accurate schedules and detailed plans, while Nick focused primarily on technical aspects, acting more as a software integrator and trouble-shooter.

Nick as a Project Manager: Nick's technical skills and dedication are evident, but as a project manager, he fell short in managing all aspects of the project. While he successfully delivered the product on time, his lack of focus on managerial responsibilities led to dissatisfaction from top management.

Support from Top Management: Top management could have provided clearer guidance and support to Nick in his new role as project manager. They should have communicated their expectations more explicitly and provided resources or training to help him fulfill those expectations.

Improvement for Nick: Nick could have improved his project management skills by prioritizing tasks, communicating effectively with stakeholders, and delegating responsibilities. He should have focused on creating accurate schedules and detailed plans to keep all aspects of the project on track.
