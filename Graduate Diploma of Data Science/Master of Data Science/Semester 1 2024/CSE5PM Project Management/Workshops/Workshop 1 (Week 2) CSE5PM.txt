2. How can a project manager proactively manage these risks ?

3. Give examples of three other risks/factors you think could pose threat to a project, and how they can be managed.

Answer text Question 1
Scope Creep: 

Changes happens during the projects all of the time during the scope of a project without any control. Generally, scope creep is when new requirements are added after the project has started. Often these changes are not properly reviewed. The project team is expected to deliver them with the same resources and at the same time as the original scope.



Key person Risk:

A key person is an Individual whose knowledge, creativity, inspiration, reputation, and/or skills are critical to the viability or growth of an organization, and whose loss may cripple it. 

It is usually seen in small project teams and caused due to over-reliance on one team member. 

To minimize the potential disruption of project schedule, a project manager must consider the implications, and have a key person risk management plan in place.



Strategy risk:

Strategic risk might arise from making poor business decisions, from the substandard execution of decisions, from inadequate resource allocation, or from a failure to respond well to changes in the business environment. 

Some types of strategy risks include – innovation risk, program risk, marketing risk, project risk, etc.



Operational risk:

Operational risk focuses on how things are accomplished within an organization and not necessarily what is produced or inherent within an industry. 

These risks are often associated with active decisions relating to how the organization functions and what it prioritizes. 

While the risks are not guaranteed to result in failure, lower production, or higher overall costs, they are seen as higher or lower depending on various internal management decisions. 



2. How can a project manager proactively manage these risks?

▪ In Project Management, it is widely believed that Time, Quality and Cost are conflicting constraints that it is not possible to agree and lock in these elements individually without compromising each of them. 

 ▪ The Time–Quality–Cost triangle can be used to assist with understanding the interdependencies of each element. In the Time-Quality-Cost triangle, fixing one of the constraints requires and re-adjusting the other two to match and complete the triangle.



3. Give examples of three other risks/factors you think could pose threat to a project, and how they can be managed.

Communication risk: In project management is the potential for a breakdown in communication between stakeholders, team members, and other parties involved in the project. This can be resolved by following: 

- identifying potential risks

- establish a crisis team

- communicate clearly and concisely,

- monitor and evaluation during development

- Learn and improve

- Build resilience. 



Performance risks: Performance risk occurs when the project doesn't perform as well as initially expected.

This can be resolved by:

- Building proper training with people with experience in their field.

- Build communication more efficiently with your team members

- Do some extended research and practices on the resources. 



Technology risks: Technology risks are caused by defects in any of the equipment, systems, or devices used, or by the sudden failure of a service. 

-Establishing scope and risk context.

-Identifying and analyzing risks.

-Designing risk management mitigation strategies.


Question 2.

Distinguishing Factors from Daily Routine Cyber Operations:

Political Sensitivity and Public Scrutiny:

The project involves securing political parties, which are highly sensitive entities subject to public scrutiny. Unlike routine cyber operations, any lapses in security could have severe consequences on national trust and political stability. The need for meticulous planning and execution to avoid public panic and maintain confidence in the political system sets this project apart.
Coordinated Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration:

This project demands extensive collaboration with various stakeholders, including political parties, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement. Unlike routine cyber operations, this initiative requires seamless cooperation among entities with diverse priorities and organizational structures. The coordination challenges in aligning cybersecurity strategies and practices across these distinct groups make this project uniquely complex.
Size, Complexity, Constraints, and Support:

Size and Complexity:

The project encompasses securing multiple political parties, each with its own infrastructure, processes, and potential vulnerabilities. The sheer size and complexity arise from the need to tailor solutions for different parties, ensuring comprehensive coverage. The intricate nature of political operations, varying threat landscapes, and the necessity for real-time threat intelligence further contribute to the project's enormity.
Constraints:

Time Constraint: The six-month timeframe poses a significant challenge for such a comprehensive cybersecurity initiative. Quick yet effective implementations, risk assessments, and ongoing monitoring must be conducted simultaneously.
Resource Limitations: The diverse IT infrastructures of political parties may lack standardization, requiring customized solutions. Resource limitations in terms of skilled personnel, technology, and financial constraints could impede progress.
Support Needed:

Technical Expertise: Given the sophistication of the state actor involved, specialized technical expertise is crucial. Collaboration with leading cybersecurity experts, both domestic and international, will be necessary to understand and counter evolving cyber threats effectively.
Legislative Backing: Support in terms of updated legislation and regulations to empower cybersecurity measures is essential. Clear legal frameworks must be established to facilitate information sharing and collaboration between political parties and government agencies.
Key Assumptions:

Active Participation of Political Parties:

Assuming that political parties will actively engage in the cybersecurity enhancement process, providing necessary information and access to their systems for assessment and improvement.
Continuous Threat Intelligence Sharing:

Assuming a culture of continuous threat intelligence sharing among political parties, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement to stay ahead of potential threats and vulnerabilities.
Adaptability to Evolving Threats:

Assuming that the cybersecurity measures implemented will be adaptable to the evolving tactics of the sophisticated state actor, requiring continuous monitoring, updates, and proactive responses.
Public Understanding and Support:

Assuming that the public will understand the necessity of enhanced cybersecurity measures for political parties and will support the temporary disruptions that may occur during the implementation phase for long-term national security benefits.
